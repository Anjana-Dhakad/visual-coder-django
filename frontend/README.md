# Visual Coder üöÄ

Welcome to Visual Coder, a web-based tool designed to bridge the gap between visual logic and programming. This application allows you to seamlessly convert C code into interactive flowcharts and, conversely, design flowcharts to generate corresponding C code.

It's built with React and the powerful `react-flow` library to provide a smooth, drag-and-drop experience.

## ‚ú® Features

This project is divided into two main utilities:

### 1. **Code to Flowchart**
- **Automatic Generation:** Write or paste your C code into the editor.
- **Smart Parsing:** The tool intelligently ignores comments, includes, and `main()` braces to only visualize the core logic.
- **Visual Logic:** Understand the flow of complex `if-else` conditions at a glance.
- **Interactive Canvas:** The generated flowchart is fully interactive, powered by `react-flow`.

### 2. **Flowchart to Code**
- **Drag & Drop Interface:** Easily build flowcharts by dragging nodes from the sidebar onto the canvas.
- **Custom Nodes:** Includes specific nodes for Start/End, Input/Output, and Decisions.
- **Editable Nodes:** Double-click on any node to edit its content or logic.
- **Intelligent Edge Labeling:** Automatically prompts for 'true' or 'false' paths when connecting from a decision node.
- **Syntax-Aware Code Generation:** Generates valid C code from your flowchart, automatically handling `printf` syntax and semicolons.
